Hey there !,  Great to be here with you....
This is Farmer's interaction Website through this project, I aimed to develop an interactive platform where farmers can interact with agriculture experts and other farmers to solve their queries. They can ask a Question,suggest Solutions, and can also share their success/failure experiences. Also most of the farmers can view this website in their native languages. 

You can try live experience here : https://farmerforfarmer.herokuapp.com/
